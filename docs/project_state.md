# Project State

## Current Stage

Stage: Model Specification

Internal anchor: `G2`

Previous stages:

* Research Idea Brief (`G0`) completed after user accepted the project brief, central hypothesis, candidate claims, and uncertainty list.
* Literature / Novelty Mapping (`G1`) completed after user accepted the novelty framing and prior-art risk matrix; the frozen literature corpus was created for Model Specification.

Substage: reset for fresh Model A review under the physics-first workflow.

Model status: candidate notes exist only; Model A has not been re-reviewed under the new structure; no model is validated.

Numerics status: no production PDE solver; no verified simulation.

Manuscript status: idea/project-brief level only; no validated results for writing.

Model Specification scope: convert the candidate Model A material into an auditable model specification. This stage reviews equations, variables, material functions, units, limiting cases, boundary conditions, and minimum observables. It does not perform production PDE implementation, numerical verification, figure generation, or manuscript drafting.

This document is a project-control snapshot for GPT and Codex workflows. It summarizes the current factual state of the repository without promoting candidate claims.

Stage details are tracked in `docs/stages/stage_index.md`.

## Workflow Structure

Current workflow policy:

* Formality only at state transitions.
* Physics-first everywhere else.
* Use concrete task names first; internal anchors such as `G2` are secondary labels.
* Use full TASK files and CODEX reports for repository edits, verification runs, and state transitions.
* Use lightweight physics notes for non-state-changing theoretical reasoning.

## Completed Pre-Model-Specification Work

* Research Idea Brief accepted by the user.
* Literature / Novelty Mapping accepted by the user for entry into Model Specification.
* Idea log, project brief, open questions, hypotheses, literature map, novelty framing, prior-art risk matrix, and frozen corpus created.
* Model A candidate summary exists as exploratory background only.
* Initial derivation exists as exploratory background only in `docs/derivations/initial_model_derivation.tex`.
* EXP-001 report created; derivation build succeeded in EXP-001.
* `docs/rendered/initial_model_derivation.pdf` has been generated from the derivation source.
* No model or claim has been promoted to `docs/validated/`.

## Superseded Model-Specification Work

The previous ChatGPT review at `docs/reports/exploration/GPT-REVIEW-G2-001.md` is retained as a historical artifact only. It is superseded by the workflow reset and must not be treated as current Model Specification progress, accepted blocker state, or validated evidence.

No current Model Specification sanity-check report exists after this reset.

## Active Blockers

No current Model Specification blocker list is accepted after the reset. The blocker list must be rebuilt by a fresh review of Model A under the physics-first workflow.

Standing constraints remain:

* No claim-evidence item is validated.
* Production PDE implementation remains blocked.
* Numerical verification remains blocked.
* Manuscript drafting remains blocked.

## Next Recommended Tasks

Use concrete task names. Internal anchors may be added only for ordering.

1. Re-review Candidate Model A from Scratch.
2. Rebuild the Model Specification blocker list only from the fresh review.
3. Do not promote any model or claim into `docs/validated/` until Model Specification evidence is recorded.

## Non-Bypassable Gates

* Do not move candidate material into `docs/validated/` before sanity checks and evidence are recorded.
* Do not write a production PDE solver before the model is sanity-checked.
* Do not treat numerical oscillation as evidence without grid/timestep checks and control cases.
* Do not draft strong manuscript novelty claims before literature, model, and claim-evidence matrices are populated and reviewed.
* Do not treat source appendix numerical notes as reproduced evidence until verified in this repo.

Promotion gates:

* Research Idea Brief exit (`G0`): completed; requires a project brief, central hypothesis, candidate claims, and visible uncertainty list.
* Literature / Novelty Mapping exit (`G1`): completed for Model Specification entry; requires populated literature map, novelty framing, prior-art risk matrix, and frozen retained corpus.
* Model Specification exit (`G2`): requires a model specification, sanity-check report, defined variables/parameters, limiting cases, boundary-condition audit, material-function audit, and minimum observables. It does not validate numerical claims.
* `docs/validated/`: requires sanity checks, explicit evidence, and updated claim-evidence records.
* Numerical implementation: requires a sanity-checked model, boundary-condition audit, and defined observables.
* Results: require reproducible scripts or notebooks, control cases, and convergence checks.
* Figures: require validated or clearly labeled exploratory outputs.
* Manuscript drafting: requires populated literature and claim-evidence matrices.
* Production tasks: require at least one validated target claim or a clearly scoped manuscript-production need.

## Update Protocol

Update this file whenever a task changes the project stage, blocker list, validation status, next recommended task, or workflow policy. Keep entries factual and repository-based. If evidence is missing, record the item as pending rather than inferring success.
